            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hey CSSA!
                <br><br>
                I am Quoc Hoang Vu, but you might know me better as Peter. I’m an international first-year student doing Joint Honours in Computer Science - Mathematics and a Minor in Film Studies. If you know me, you probably saw some of my 21.000 messages in Discord, my South Park sweater at the Lounge and various campus events, or my answers on COMP courses’ Piazzas. If you don’t, then know I’m some guy who’s fallen in love with the student community and is hoping to contribute positively to the student experience by running for Director of Student Affairs.
                <br><br>
                Despite being a first-year student, I am not inexperienced with student leadership roles. I recently renewed UMUN (University of Manitoba Model United Nations) as the Secretary-General. Before that, I was Vice President at my high school’s Japanese Culture Club, where we organized a culture festival with attendance reaching 4,000+ and donated $4,500 to charity. Furthermore, I am currently a Councillor at CSSA, where I contribute to projects such as the First Year Guide under the guidance of the current Executive Team. Lastly, I’m in good standing with members of the Department, involving myself via partaking in instructors’ interviews and attending talks.

            <h1>My Campaign</h1>
            <p>I know there’s a massive gap in communication between the Department and the student body, and my goal is to lessen that gap as much as possible. With regular surveys, invitation of Departmental members to events, and a very active response time from my end, I will add transparency to the hard work the Department is putting in in service of the student body that everyone may not be aware of, as well as be the messenger of the student body to keep the Department in the loop. There are rightful frustrations that many students are experiencing as part of the program. Though I can’t guarantee said problems will be solved during my term or any term afterward, I wish to set a precedent for future Directors of Student Affairs to maintain this form of direct and transparent communication between students and faculty.
                <br><br>
                Beyond that, I will foster a more welcoming and inclusive CSSA space for all. As much fun as I have to chat away with people on Discord or at our events, I understand that, compared to the massive population of CS students in the University, people like us are the loud minority. I have met many people during COMP 1010, yet I don’t see them around in CSSA activities. Though everyone has their reason to not engage, I believe we can do better in trying to be a more welcoming space. My policies will focus heavily on the newer members of the CS community, the current and future first-year students. Our spaces, such as the Discord server or Lounge, will be retrofitted to be more welcoming and empowering. I will also improve academic experiences via guides such as the aforementioned First Year Guide (which will come out before next year’s course registration, FYI) and connections with official resources such as the Computer Science Help Center.

            <h1>Closing Words</h1>
            <p>I chose to run as Director of Student Affairs because I'm convinced I can make the greatest difference in the student experience in this position. I want to do everything in my power to give back to the community that welcomed me with open arms during my first year abroad, and to open it up for current and future students to feel welcome and heard. If you have faith in me, whether from this bio or from engaging with me for the past half-year, make sure to cast your vote!
